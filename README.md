Description:
A system that allows users to create and reserve boats.
This is a learning project and is not intended for production use.

To install the system, clone the repository. Run 'Bundle Install' and start the Rack Server and visit the index site in a web browser.

Contributing:
Feel free to fork the repository and use as you will.  At this point in time, I will not be seeking outside contribtutions since this is just a basic learning project.
